# D1 Progress Form for Friday
# =======================================

# Can your power supply settle on a desired setpoint? (yes/no) 
#
:Reach setpoint: yes



# Without external load what is the maximal peak-to-peak variation (e.g. oscillation)? [mV]:
#
:Steady state var: 200 


# If you change the setpoint how long does it take to reach the new output value? 
# State start voltage, end voltage and time:
#
:Step start: 2
:Step end: 10
:Step time: 240



# If you apply an external load can your power supply reestablish the desired output voltage?
# State Set point (V), Load applied (Ohm), time to reach new voltage (within 5% band), voltage under load  
#
:Setpoint: 3.4
:Load: 150
:Time to settle: 260
:V under load: 3.41



# If you remove the load, how far does the output exceed the setpoint [V]?  
# State Set point (V), Load applied (Ohm), maximum voltage reached [V] 
#
:Setpoint over shoot: 2.16
:Load removed: 150
:Peak voltage: 5.6



# What control method did you use for the above? (e.g., Incremental, proportional, PID) 
#
:Final control: PID


# Over what setpoint range is your power supply usable [V]? (e.g., 4 or 3-8)  
#
:Setpoint range: 1 to 12


# What current limit did you use for the setpoint (range) in the previous question [A]? 
#
:I lim: 0.44



# Your impression of the final day in ONE word:
#
:In a word: Great!
